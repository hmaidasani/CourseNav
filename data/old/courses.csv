It is taught 5 days per week for the first 5 weeks, then leads directly into a special section of MATH115, the same semester, which also meets 5 days per week. Continuation in MATH115 is conditional on the student passing the MATHEMATICS PLACEMENT EXAM at the appropriate level. Topics include exponents, polynomials, linear equations in one and two variables, quadratic equations, as well as polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithm functions. MATH015 does not carry any credit toward any degree at the University, nor is it graded.
