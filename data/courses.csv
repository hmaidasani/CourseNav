ECON175,0105,"Inequality: Determinants and Policy Remedies",Discussion,"Ethan Kaplan","Through most of the 20th century gaps in income between rich and poor declined in the US, but after 1970 we experienced a very rapid increase in inequality. This course challenges students to investigate why people make different amounts of money, why income inequality has risen so dramatically in recent years, what public policy tools exist to counter inequality increases, and what different institutional arrangements different countries use to lower inequality. This course will introduce students to theoretical tools used by economists to understand the sources of inequality and will also examine empirical evidence to better understand changes in the wage distribution and, more generally, in income distribution.",ASY 3207,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,--,13:00:00,13:50:00
